# iTunes Graphs

iTunes Graphs is a Cocoa-based macOS app which visualises your iTunes library in a series of pie charts.
Currently, it supports the following graphs:

 - Artists
 - Genres
 - Decades
 
I've also made an [iOS version](https://github.com/zac-garby/music-stats).

There's a build in the *Releases* section on GitHub.
